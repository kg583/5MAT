# 5MAT

5MAT is an esoteric programming language (esolang) derived from Common Lisp's utterly unique string formatting capabilities. It quickly evolved into a stack of languages, the nMATs, which build upon each other to yield an amazingly cohesive bridge between a sensible language and a ridiculous compilation target. Let's take a trip and see how we got ourselves into this beautiful mess.

## 4MAT

Like most sensible languages, Common Lisp has a handy-dandy function for producing and combining string representations of various objects, so creatively named `format`. Its facilities are familiar to users of C's `printf` or Python's f-strings: a string containing some magic character sequences has those sequences replaced with representations of the arguments passed in, the rest of the string being the glue connecting said arguments together for our needy human eyes.

```lisp
(format nil "This number has padding: ~3,'0d. This one's in hex: ~x." 9 254)
>>> "This number has padding: 009. This one's in hex: FE."
```

The [Common Lisp HyperSpec](https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/22_c.htm) is the definitive description of exactly what `format` does and does not do. Many implementations exist across the many Lisps and Schemes of the world, but we choose to use [GNU CLISP's](https://gitlab.com/gnu-clisp/clisp/-/blob/master/src/format.lisp?ref_type=heads). A common theme in this project, the code is a beautiful mess, but still leaves much to be desired in terms of speed and interoperability.

Thus, `lib/fourmat/` contains a standalone, spec-compliant `format` implementation, written in Python. Documentation can be found in `docs/4MAT.md`. There are still many pieces to implement, including those not needed for the next step: making `format` Turing-complete (though we will get around to them, for completeness[^1]).

## 5MAT

Formatters across languages are often quite terse and quite powerful[^2], and `format` is the king of them all (to us, anyway). Its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Format_(Common_Lisp)?useskin=vector) is a fantastic synopsis, but I think the following chapter title from the HyperSpec should be enough to convince you of the tomfuckery we are about to employ:

> 22.3.7 FORMAT Control-Flow Operations

Indeed, `format` is armed with the power to loop, backtrack, and dance wildly across its arguments. Further empowered with conditionals, break statements, and even external function calls, one might, nay *should*, naturally ask if `format` is Turing-complete. The answer is **yes... with a few modifications**. These modifications grant us 5MAT, a Turing-complete esolang whose source is a single Common Lisp FORMAT string.

Don't believe me? Head down into the `lib/fivemat/` directory to see how it works for yourself! Documentation is available in `docs/5MAT.md`, with a normative Lisp version of the interpreter in `docs/lisp/`. Many instructive sample programs can be found in `docs/samples/5MAT/`. Only a few realizations (beyond base knowledge of `format`) are necessary to make it all come together, and once familiar with its fundamental directives, reading and writing 5MAT *can* become quite natural.


## 6MAT

Anything is possible in 5MAT, and devising basic programs to show a glimpse of how is a delightful excursion... for a time. A nice handwritten FizzBuzz or Fibonacci iterator nears the limit of most 5matters'[^3] acceptable tedium and headache, and thus one would reasonably enjoy some tools that can help them along.

[^3]: At the time of writing, there exist precisely 1Â½ fluent 5matters.

Enter 6MAT, one abstraction level up from raw 5MAT. Programs are written using an assembly-like syntax, with instructions and control flow blocks corresponding to sequences of format directives. Certain common 5MAT snippets can be realized with just one instruction, and directives useless to 5MAT's computation model need not clutter your mind.

The `lib/sixmat/` directory contains an assembler and optimizer. `docs/6MAT.md` contains a detailed instruction and paradigm guide, and many instructive sample programs can be found in `docs/samples/6MAT/`.


## 7MAT

But can we go further beyond? 6MAT is more-or-less directly translation into 5MAT, with little by way of *semantic* abstraction to help inspired programmers. Though it does morph an affront to Lisp itself into more of an assembly language for a weird computer, this is hardly enough mental relief to concoct truly complex programs.

And what does one do with assembly languages besides compile into them. Thus, we devise 7MAT, a low-level declarative language with variables, data types, and a plethora of other features that comprise the bare minimum for actually usable languages.

The process of compiling 7MAT to 6MAT requires far more inventive thinking than anything previous, requiring a sophisticated tape layout and calling convention to permit actions such as adding two numbers together without any mental overhead for the programmer. Devising these devices is an ongoing process, so stay tuned; our progress thus far is visible in the `lib/sevenmat/` directory.
